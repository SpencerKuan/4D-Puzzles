# [4D-Puzzles](https://spencerkuan.github.io/4D-Puzzles/)

A short proof-of-concept first-person platformer with movement and rotations in the 4th dimension. 


## Controls

### Moving
- WASD to move in the usual directions. 
- Q and E serve as movement in two additional directions that are perpendicular to the other three. 
- Spacebar to jump. 

### Turning
- Move the mouse to turn. 
- Scroll on the mouse wheel to use an interesting 4D rotation. 
- Alternatively, use UIOJKL to change the player's direction. 

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to touch the cube located at the end of each level without falling off of the map. Getting to the end of a level may require jumping, turning in 4D, and moving in non-intuitive directions.
